# Transformer Model: English-to-German Translation  

This project implements a **Transformer model from scratch**, inspired by the **"Attention Is All You Need"** paper. The goal is to build a **PyTorch-based English-to-German translation model**, reinforcing fundamental concepts of transformer architectures.
